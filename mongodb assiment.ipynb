    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios is it preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "#ans\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL, document-oriented database designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike traditional SQL databases, which use structured tables with rows and columns, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents (BSON) that allow for flexible and hierarchical data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases (NoSQL) are databases that do not use the traditional relational model. They are designed to handle various types of data and are often used when:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: Horizontal scaling is needed to handle large volumes of data.\n",
    "Flexibility: The data model can evolve over time without affecting existing data.\n",
    "Variety of Data: The data includes semi-structured or unstructured data (e.g., JSON).\n",
    "Scenarios where MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Schema: When the data schema is dynamic or evolves frequently.\n",
    "High Volume Data: When dealing with large volumes of data and requiring horizontal scaling.\n",
    "Unstructured Data: When storing complex and unstructured data types such as JSON documents.\n",
    "Real-time Analytics: When performing real-time analytics or aggregations on large dataset\n",
    "\n",

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "#Ans\n",
    "Document-Oriented Storage: Stores data in JSON-like documents (BSON), which allows for a flexible schema and hierarchical data storage.\n",
    "Scalability: Provides horizontal scaling through sharding, enabling the distribution of data across multiple servers.\n",
    "Indexing: Supports various types of indexes to improve query performance, including single-field, compound, geospatial, and text indexes.\n",
    "Aggregation Framework: Offers powerful aggregation operations for querying and transforming data.\n",
    "Replication: Ensures high availability through replica sets, which provide automated failover and data redundancy.\n",
    "Flexible Schema: Allows documents within the same collection to have different structures, enabling easy schema evolution.\n",
    "Rich Query Language: Provides a rich query language with support for CRUD operations, data manipulation, and complex queries.\n",
